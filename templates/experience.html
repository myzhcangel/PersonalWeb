          My very first experience is about image processing and analysis. Launched by Stanford EE, the program asked for approaches for registering or aligning two medical images from different medical equipments of the same part of body. In this project, I explored methods on registration of medical images from different pieces of equipment.

        <!-- <ul> -->
          <li>
            Method One: I realized image registration by choosing several pairs of points according to different models and applying them to affine transformation. This method succeeded in realizing the goal.
          </li>
          <li>
            Method Two: I realized image registration by calculating mutual information from two images and looking for the exact positions when the value reached a peak. This method could work automatically and gain higher accuracy.
          </li>

          During the summer break in 2016, I assisted in a natural language processing project of building up a medical ontology database. My main work includes:
          <li>Wrote a web crawler to extract jargons and used regular expression to extracted needed expressions.
          </li>
          <li>Implemented word embedding techniques to train word vectors, based on which to find synonyms and related words and differentiate them by analyzing their distribution.
          </li>
          <li>Used LTP tool to test Chinese texts segmentation and explored a new method based on Topwords. The former performed better in segmenting regular words while the latter performed better in segmenting technical words.

          In this experience, I assisted in eliminating false positives of a railway security system. My main work includes:
          <li>Collected data from an existing WI-FI system that is used to monitor intruders.
          </li>
          <li>Extracted different features of those data of warnings, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Local Outlier Factor (LOF).
          </li>
          <li>Used image features and LOF to reduce false positives by over 90% with an optimized SVM classification.

          We took this project from Kaggle as our course project in Data Mining. What we did was to predict whether a shot of Kobe was a successful one based on his shoting situation. We applied dummy coding and adaptive feature clustering based on KNN in feature pre-processing, and then used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, GBDT and XGBoost as the prediction models. Our best model ranked 38 over 1117 in the end.
